interface

repozytorium -> ctor with IcosmosStore enter to DI - let get and change data from dastabase
 public CosmosClientRepository(ICosmosStore<CosmosClient> clientRepository)

 in repository methods are using cosmonaut not EFW -   var posts = await _cosmosStore.Query().ToListAsync();

 add client - generate guid first - special class to prepare id for you

 after implementing all repositories methods and interfaces simillary to EF solution

 create cosmos installer < - install package cosmonaut.extansions dependency injection
